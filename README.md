# Stochastic Computing Adders: Mux, CeMux, APC, and PSA

This MATLAB project simulates and analyzes the accuracy vs. area trade-offs of four large-scale stochastic computing adders:
- **Mux adder**: smallest area, lowest accuracy
- **CeMux adder**: correlation-enhanced multiplexer, better accuracy
- **APC (Accumulative Parallel Counter)**: highest accuracy, largest area
- **PSA (Parallel Sampling Adder)**: hybrid design with tunable trade-off

It reproduces and extends the ideas from the paper:
> *Design of Large-Scale Stochastic Computing Adders and Their Anomalous Behavior* (DATE 2023) by Timothy Baker and John P. Hayes
